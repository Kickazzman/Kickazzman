<!--
**Kickazzman/Kickazzman** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting a nursing degree and learning to program to one day make a suite of life saving software
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, C++, blender, and ofcourse literature about the human body
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all things programming and or health related
